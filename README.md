# Clearweather - weather app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Live version

You can visit live version of this project here: [ClearweatherApp](https://clearweather.netlify.app/)

## Tech stack
Project is built with:
- React
- Redux
- react-router
- styled components
- framer motion
- storybook - to create, style, and control the behavior of components outside of the app

I've used Husky and lint-staged for make sure the code is error free before commits

## How to fire up this app?

Firstly first clone this repository and then in the project directory run these commands below:

### `npm start`

it'll run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


There are currently no tests :(
